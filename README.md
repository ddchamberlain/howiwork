**What is this?** â€” The world is changing. I hear the world of work is changing. I know I am changing. I hope you are changing. This document outlines how I am trying to line all of these things up right now, spelling out how I am using my calendar, communication tools, hours, and relationships to do impactful work, maintain some balance in my life, and support the folks I work with as effectively as I can.

**TL;DR**
**About Me / My Job**â€Šâ€”â€ŠDoing [my job](https://www.library.dartmouth.edu/directory/f003frf) effectively requires collaborating with people all day every day. About a third of my work time is spent on supporting teams and advancing team-level initatives across the Dartmouth Library. Another third is spent on organization-level issues. The final third is spent on partnerships beyond the Library, across Dartmouth, with network partners, and exploring potential new partnerships and ideas.   

**How to communicate with me**â€Šâ€”â€ŠI am happy to communicate in whatever way is best for you, and can be quite flexible with timing, tools, and modes. If you really want to know what I prefer:
 - I like walks, outdoor meetings, and slack huddles. 
 - I am willing to meet indoors or over zoom (and schedule a default zoom for every meeting just in case). I'd prefer to meet in your conference room to my office, but my space is always available for more private conversations. 
 - I like quick slack exchanges at appropriate times.
 - I like contextualizing communications in appropriate places: running google team meeting agendas and 1-1 meetings notes; project management software for larger projects; working files in organized google shared drives for longer writeups. I also like experimenting with tools that might do this better - right now I am playing around with: ~~asana~~ ~~trello~~ ~~notion~~ fellow
 - I like visiting with folks across the Library and across campus, and often use my unbooked work time to check in on folks
 - My door is always open metaphorically, but in reality my office doore is usually closed. I do have a little sign on it that sometimes says "visitors welcome"!

**How to interpret my calendar**â€Šâ€”â€ŠI work to manage all of this collaboration through careful scheduling, time blocking, and intentional location changes. I use a lot of calendaring tools and features so that I can effectively manage my time and communicate to others when I am most likely to be available:

*Outlook indicators for times I am **very likely** to be available or synchronously responsive*
 - Regular calendar time set aside just for you! 
 - Calendar items that say Bookable 1-1 time and are marked "tentative." These are slots that I have 100% set aside to chat with folks in the Dartmouth Library, on the teams I support or otherwise. Please book as many slots as you'd like using [my open office hours calendly page](https://calendly.com/danielchamberlain/open-office-hours?month=2022-05).
 - Calendar slots that are open. In my ideal scenario these will either be used for meetings with working groups or projects (or give me some extra focused time), but if it is not booked you should feel free to schedule some time (outlook meeting invite is fine, but if you like calendar bots you can use my [full calendly page](https://calendly.com/danielchamberlain)) or send me a synchronous message

*Outlook indicators for times I am **fairly likely** to be responsive, and could probably meet if needed*
 - Calendar items that say "tentative" and/or start with the word "Hold." I'll turn them "busy" if I need to focus.
 - Calendar items that say "free." These tend to be webinars I am keeping one ear on, but I'll be happy to connect with you instead 

*Outlook indicators for times I am **unlikely** to be responsive*
 - Calendar items that show Busy+Private are booked for me
 - Calendar items that show "Busy" are either dedicated meetings or dedicate focus time, which either way means I am unlikley to be synchronously responsive  
 - Calendar items that show me as working elsewhere (or remote)

Slack indicators connected to all of this: 
 - ðŸŸ¢ with no status - I am available and likely to be responsive
 - ðŸŸ¢ with custom status - depends on the status
 - ðŸŸ¢ with :calendar: status - I am not available/responsive
 - ðŸŸ¢ with :house_with_garden: status - I am not available/responsive
 - :empty_circle: or ðŸ˜´ - I am not available/responsive. My notifications turn off at 5:30pm every day, rain or shine. You might consider scheduling your message for the next day, but should feel free to "notify anyway" if you need me to see something that night. That is not a 100% guarantee that I'll see it, but I usually check once in the late evening just in case of urgent issues.
